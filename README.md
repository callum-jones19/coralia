# VITE MUSIC


## Overview

This is a local-only music player ðŸŽ¶. It creates an internal library from a specified
set of local folders and allows you to browse songs and albums, search through them and
queue thousands of songs at a time.

This is written in Rust ðŸ¦€ and Typescript . The aim is to have a clean, adaptable UI
while supporting efficient playback with full cross-platform support. Minimal bloat,
maximum performance.

## Installation

Currently, this is not in any package managers (and probably will not be for a while - I
have very limited free time, so will do it when I can). The current options are either to
build from source, or download a pre-compiled binary from the [GitHub Releases page]().

To build from source, please see the instructions [here](#building-from-source).

## Issues

There will likely be small bugs here and there - I do my best to address them, but
the nature of this app as a side-project means that some will inevitably fall through the
cracks. If you find a bug, please feel free to open an issue, and I will take a look at it
when I have time.
