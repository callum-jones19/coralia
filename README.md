# Coralia

## Overview

Coralia is a local-only music player ðŸŽ¶. It creates an internal library from a specified
set of local folders and allows you to browse songs and albums, search through them and
queue thousands of songs at a time.

Coralia is written in Rust ðŸ¦€ and Typescript ðŸŽ‰. The aim is to have a clean, adaptable UI
while supporting efficient playback with full cross-platform support. Minimal bloat,
maximum performance.

## Installation

Currently, this is not in any package managers (and probably will not be for a while - I
have very limited free time, so will do it when/if I can). The current options are either to
build from source, or download a pre-compiled binary from the
[GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/callum-jones19/coralia/releases).

To build from source, please make sure you have installed Tauri 2.0. From the
root of the repository, `npm instasll` and then run `tauri build` as outlined
in the Tauri 2.0 docs [here](https://tauri.app/distribute/). Prerequisites will
depend on the OS/distribution you are building on.

## Issues

There will likely be small bugs here and there - I do my best to address them, but
the nature of this app as a side-project means that some will inevitably fall through the
cracks. If you find a bug, please feel free to open an issue, and I will take a look at it
when I have time.
